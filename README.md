- 👋 Hi, I’m @mma-dev-92
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematical modelling, machine learning and algorithm puzzles :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about applying fft (fourier conversion) to linear programs 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate: advanced mathematical modelling (LP, MILP, decomposition methods, FFT, ...)
- 📫 How to reach me - just email me @maciek.mazurek@protonmail.com
